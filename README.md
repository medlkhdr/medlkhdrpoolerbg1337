# 1337 Benguerir Pool - August 2024

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! This repository showcases the projects and code I worked on during the August 2024 pool at 1337 Benguerir. It was an intense and exciting experience, where I got to dive deep into C programming and tackle various challenges.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the code I developed over the course of the pool. The projects were focused on basic C programming and foundational algorithms. Although the tasks were straightforward, they played a crucial role in solidifying my understanding of key programming concepts.

## My Journey

Working on these projects was both educational and enjoyable. The pool was a great opportunity to practice and apply what I’ve learned, and it marked the beginning of my journey in the world of programming. I’m excited to continue developing my skills and taking on new challenges.

## Future Development

This is just the start! I’m committed to growing as a programmer and plan to keep pushing my skills further. Stay tuned for more projects and updates as I continue to learn and evolve.
